Original Description:  

# nseeod
NSE EOD Data Downloader was built out of my frustration of not getting valid free stock price data at the tip of my hands, and sharing this project has only made lives easier for people like me who are interested in analyzing stock price data.

I have noticed a lot of source code downloads on https://sourceforge.net/projects/nse-eod/ and I only feel content that a lot of you might have build their own hacks out of this project. If you too believe in sharing your work then do submit your hacks or bug fixes so that we can make this software better.

GitHub is a great platform where you can share your work with me. So the next time if you are looking forward to build something crazy out of this project, just fork it from here.

What to expect in Next Major release:
Added features. Adding MCX.

What to expect in Next Minor release:
Release will include minor code refactoring like removing magic strings and making code more modular and small bug fixes if reported.
